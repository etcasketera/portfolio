                <p>Hello! I'm Etash Chandran, a passionate student from The University of Texas at Austin pursuing dual degrees in Advertising and Business Analytics with a focus on communications strategy, marketing analytics, and media planning.</p>
                
                <p>My academic journey has been enriched by hands-on experience in the field. From managing digital marketing strategies to conducting in-depth market research, I've developed a versatile skill set that combines creative thinking with analytical precision. As part of the Moody College of Communications Honors Program, I've had the opportunity to explore the evolving landscape of advertising and communications, gaining insights that extend beyond the classroom.</p>
                
                <p>My experience with the National Student Advertising Competition, where I served as Strategy Director for AT&T, has been particularly formative. Leading a team to develop a comprehensive campaign targeting Gen Z audiences, I honed my skills in strategic planning, consumer research, and message development.</p>
                
                <p>I'm particularly interested in the intersection of data and creativity. I believe that the most effective communications strategies are those informed by robust analytics and executed with creative excellence. My technical proficiencies include Python, R, SQL, and various digital marketing tools that enable me to bridge these two worlds.</p>
                
                <p>Looking ahead, I'm excited to continue exploring opportunities in marketing analytics and communications strategy, with the goal of helping brands forge meaningful connections with their audiences. I'm particularly drawn to roles that challenge me to apply both my analytical mindset and creative vision.</p>
                
                <p>Outside of my professional pursuits, I enjoy history, bodybuilding, DJing, cooking, and playing card and board games. I believe these diverse interests contribute to my well-rounded approach to problem-solving and creativity in the workplace.</p>
